# Nyxis: Turn Your Curiosity into Understanding
*Your personal AI companion for exploring ideas and discovering connections*

## What is Nyxis?
Nyxis is a beautiful, intuitive app that helps you capture and explore your interests, discovering fascinating connections you never knew existed. Think of it as your personal knowledge explorer that grows smarter as you use it.

## Core Features

### 1. The Void
*Your gateway to discovery*

Imagine opening Netflix, but instead of movie recommendations, you get fascinating concepts to explore. Each visit presents you with three intriguing ideas based on your interests.

**Example:**
```
You open Nyxis and see:
- "Why do we find certain music beautiful?"
- "How do successful people think differently?"
- "What makes some stories resonate across cultures?"
```

### 2. Sparks
*Capture moments of fascination*

Ever had that moment when something really catches your interest? A YouTube video, a conversation, a random thought? Sparks lets you quickly capture these moments before they fade.

**Examples:**
```
ðŸ“± "Just watched a video about how SpaceX lands rockets - mind blown!"
ðŸ’­ "Interesting conversation about why some apps go viral"
ðŸ“– "Reading about how successful people organize their day"
```

### 3. Rabbitholes
*Guided exploration of your interests*
